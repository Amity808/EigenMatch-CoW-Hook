## See EigenAI in Action

We built [deterministicinference.com](https://deterministicinference.com/) to showcase EigenAI in action.

When you run a comparison, your prompt is executed in 3 ways:

1. With OpenAI 
2. With EigenAI along with a seed you select.
3. With EigenAI along with a randomly generated seed.

EigenAI provides determinism. You'll see the results coming back from OpenAI change, while the results coming from EigenAI are identical and reproducible.
