The EigenAI API is compatible with the OpenAI API and uses open-source LLMs. You can simply place the API endpoint in your existing application to
start shipping deterministic, verifiable AI-based applications. You can use the EigenAI as a direct replacement in your existing 
workflows without rewriting code or changing your integration logic. Simply update your API endpoint to point to EigenAI, and 
your application will continue to function exactly as before but with deterministic and verifiable outputs.

This compatibility extends to familiar features such as:
* Prompt and parameter formats identical to those used in OpenAI endpoints.
* Client libraries that work out of the box — including the OpenAI SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and others.
* Response schemas that mirror existing API structures, ensuring your downstream parsing and evaluation logic remains unchanged.

By design, EigenAI minimizes friction for teams migrating to deterministic infrastructure.
