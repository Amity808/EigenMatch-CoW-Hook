## What is EigenLayer

EigenLayer is a protocol for developers wanting to easily build custom, verifiable, offchain computation into their applications.

At the application level, EigenLayer scales onchain applications by enabling verifiable, offchain compute to be integrated
and secured onchain.

At the protocol level, EigenLayer creates and enforces commitments. Operators are entities that make commitments. The commitments
are made to AVSs (Autonomous Verifiable Services). AVSs use EigenLayer to encode and enforce commitments. AVSs consumers 
benefit from the commitments Operators make.

## Why build a service on EigenLayer

You want:
* To extend your onchain application using verifiable, offchain compute to increase programmability.
* Flexibility to build any application, feature, or service, while still benefiting from the 
security that blockchains provide.
* The easiest and fastest access to security so that you can focus on building our your core product

Consumers want a service that they can trust. AVSs increase trust by bringing commitments onchain verifiably, and using EigenLayer
to provide cryptoeconomic security

## What types of services can be built on EigenLayer

Services with commitments to:
* Perform assigned tasks (for example, compute, coprocessors, storing DA blobs)
* Take on roles (for example, insurance, RPC maintainers, keepers)
* Make decisions (for example, governance, intersubjective oracles)
* Participate in events (for example, games)
* Agree to constraints (for example, proposer commitments, fast finality, cheap implementation of unusual Defi positions)

## How do I get started

If your service is task based, use the DevKit with the task-based AVS template to get started.

For other types of commitments, refer to the [EigenLayer documentation](../developers/howto/get-started-without-devkit/implement-minimum-onchain-components.md).
