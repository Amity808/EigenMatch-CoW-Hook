> Click [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli)  get started building with DevKit.

The task-based framework Hourglass provides the onchain and offchain infrastructure to run task-based AVSs. 
Hourglass enables you to extend your smart contracts by using an offchain coprocessor AVS.

DevKit gives developers a CLI toolkit to build, test, and deploy AVSs built using the Hourglass framework with minimal friction.

## What DevKit Provides 

DevKit is the unified, first-party CLI toolkit for EigenCloud. DevKit gets you from zero to a working product in under an hour. Like Foundry, but for building verifiable off-chain services.

DevKit gives you:
* Commands to simplify development including: 
    * One to scaffold your project.
    * Another to spin up a local devnet with everything you need, Ethereum node, task infrastructure, Operator simulation, all containerized and ready to go.
* Opinionated defaults that work out of the box.
* Local-first development for rapid iteration.
* Clear path from proof-of-concept to testnet and mainnet deployment.

## What Hourglass Provides 

Hourglass is a task-based AVS framework. Hourglass provides onchain and offchain infrastructure for building task-based AVS. 
Using the Hourglass framework simplifies the process of building, deploying, and maintaining task-based AVS.

Hourglass provides:
* Onchain infrastructure to enable:
    * Onchain task management
    * Operator registration and management
    * Verification of Operator certificates
* Offchain infrastructure to enable offchain task management, and publishing of offchain results onchain.
