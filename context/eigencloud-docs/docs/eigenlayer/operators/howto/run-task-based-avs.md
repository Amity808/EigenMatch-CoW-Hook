The Hourglass CLI (`hgctl`) is a comprehensive CLI toolkit for deploying and managing Hourglass task-based AVS and 
EigenLayer Operator operations.

:::tip install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli/main/install-devkit.sh | bash
:::

`hgctl` streamlines AVS operations for Hourglass task-based AVS, enabling you to:

* Deploy and manage AVS components
* Register and manage EigenLayer operators with full lifecycle support
* Handle keystores and signing operations (BLS/ECDSA)
* Manage Operator allocations, delegations, and deposits
* Configure and manage multiple environments
* Fetch and deploy Hourglass task-based AVS releases from OCI registries via ReleaseManager contracts.

For more information on `hgctl`, refer to the [README](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hourglass-monorepo/blob/master/hgctl-go/README.md).

For information on Operator concepts, and operating all other AVS, refer to the [EigenLayer](../../concepts/eigenlayer-overview.md)
and [Operator](../concepts/operator-introduction.md) documentation.
