:::important
The TEE mnemonic is generated by the KMS and bound to your app's enclave. Once injected, 
the mnemonic safety depends on the app not leaking it.

Any mnemonic you see in `.env.example` is a placeholder for local development. The TEE overwrites the placeholder with the
actual KMS-generated mnemonic that's unique and persistent to your app. Only your specific TEE instance can decrypt and use this mnemonic.
:::

When deployed, EigenCompute apps receive a persistent and private wallet that serves as the cryptographic identity, allowing the app to 
sign transactions, hold funds, and operate autonomously.

The TEE mnemonic is generated by the KMS and only decryptable inside your specific TEE application. It is provided at runtime
using the `MNEMONIC` environment variable. The wallet addresses are derived from the TEE mnemonic.

## Derive Address from TEE Mnemonic

### Etheruem

To derive the Etheruem wallet address from the `MNEMONIC` environment variable:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="ethers" label="ethers.js">
    ```typescript
    const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;
    if (!mnemonic) {
      throw new Error('MNEMONIC environment variable is not set');
    }

    const wallet = ethers.Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic);
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript/JavaScript">
    ```typescript
    // TypeScript/JavaScript example
    import { mnemonicToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'

    const account = mnemonicToAccount(process.env.MNEMONIC) 
    ``` 
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
   ```python
   # Python example 
   import os
   from eth_account import Account

   Account.enable_unaudited_hdwallet_features()
   account = Account.from_mnemonic(os.environ['MNEMONIC'])
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="viem" label="view.sh">
   Refer to the [`mnemonicToAccount` documentation](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local/mnemonicToAccount)
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Solana

To derive the Solana address from the `MNEMONIC` environment variable, refer to the [Solana Wallets documentation](http://solana.com/developers/cookbook/wallets/restore-from-mnemonic#restoring-bip44-format-mnemonics).
