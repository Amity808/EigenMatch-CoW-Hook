EigenCompute uses two types of keys: 

* Authentication keys

    For developers and used for deployments and protocol interactions.

* TEE mnemonic 

    For applications and used for persistent wallet functionality inside the TEE. Also provides the ability to verify that you are communicating with the correct TEE application.
  


## Authentication keys

:::tip
The authentication keys are a cryptographic key pair.

The private key is used to sign deployment transactions. From that private key, a public key is derived, and from
the public key, an address is generated.

The address is your EigenCompute onchain identification, often referred to as a wallet, and must be funded before deployment.

| Origin    | Generated or imported using `eigenx auth` CLI command                                                                                                                            | 
| Location  | Local OS or organization keyring (macOS Keychain, 1Password, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service, etc.). Stored under `eigenx-<environment>` (eg, `eigenx-mainnet`) |
| Security  | Developer must secure and store the authentication keys securely to sign deployment transactions                                                                                 |

## TEE Mnemonic 

:::important
The TEE mnemonic is generated by the KMS and bound to your app's enclave, ensuring consistency across deployments. Once injected, the mnemonic safety depends on the app not leaking it.

| Security    | The mnemonic is cryptographically bound to your specific TEE instance. No other TEE, application, or party can decrypt it. Inside the TEE, it's a plain secret and must be handled appropriately. Do not log or exfiltrate the mnemonic. |
