EigenCompute enables verifiable trust guarantees for your application. Currently, EigenCompute enables trust guarantees for:
* Hardware-isolated execution. Your app runs inside Intel TDX, a secure enclave with encrypted memory that generates cryptographic proof of the exact Docker 
image running inside.
* Onchain deployment record. Every deployment is permanently recorded onchain, creating an immutable audit trail.

Roadmap items in active development will enable EigenCompute to provide similar guarantees to blockchain smart contracts, including:

* Verifiable execution
* Forced inclusion
* Liveness guarantees
* Upgrade delays.

## Verification Dashboards

The Verification Dashboards for [Mainnet](https://verify.eigencloud.xyz/) and [Sepolia testnet](https://verify-sepolia.eigencloud.xyz/) display data to verify EigenCloud trust guarantees.

For information on how to view verification data and what's displayed, refer to [Verify Trust Guarantees](../howto/verify/verify-trust-guarantees.md).
